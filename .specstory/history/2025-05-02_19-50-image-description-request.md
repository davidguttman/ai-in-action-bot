Okay, Big D.

First, I need to understand the project context. I'll read the `PROJECT.md` file.

---

Could not find file 'docs/PROJECT.md' in the workspace.

---

It seems `docs/PROJECT.md` doesn't exist, Big D.

Next, I'll get the directory structure using `tree`.

Thanks, Big D. I see the structure now. There's a `PROJECT.md` at the root, not in `docs/`. I'll read that one.

---

Read file: PROJECT.md

---

Okay, Big D. The `PROJECT.md` just says "See readme". I'll read the `README.md` next.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Got it, Big D. I've read the `README.md` and understand the project is a Discord bot for scheduling, using an LLM and MongoDB.

Now, regarding the image you sent:

This image is a screenshot from a Discord channel titled "Speaker Sign-up - cakecrusher", dated May 2, 2025. The channel was started by the "AI In Action Bot".

The screenshot captures a brief conversation:

1.  At 10:30 AM, a user named "SebastianS" messages the "AI In Action Bot" saying, "correct senor bot, looking forward to run through it". This seems to be a confirmation or agreement in response to a previous interaction, possibly an offer from the bot to help SebastianS sign up to speak.
2.  At 10:31 AM, the "AI In Action Bot" replies, acknowledging SebastianS's offer to speak ("Hi @SebastianS, thanks for offering to speak!"). It then prompts SebastianS for the next piece of information needed for scheduling: "To get you scheduled, could you please tell me your presentation topic?".

The bot's message has three reactions: ðŸ˜‚ (laughing), ðŸ¤” (thinking), and ðŸ™‚ (slightly smiling).

---

_**User**_

This is a bug. The bot thinks the user SebastianS want's to sign up for a talk. They don't they were just mentioning the bot/replying to something the bot said

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, Big D. I understand the issue. The bot is too eager and assumes any positive reply in the sign-up thread means the user wants to proceed, leading to the incorrect response shown in the image.

Let's fix this. According to the `README.md` and the project structure, the core Discord logic should be in `lib/discord/index.js`. I'll read this file to find where incoming messages are processed, especially within threads created by the bot.

---

Read file: lib/discord/index.js

---

Okay, Big D. I've reviewed `lib/discord/index.js`.

The relevant logic is within the `client.on(Events.MessageCreate, ...)` handler, specifically this block:

```javascript
    const signupInfo = activeSignups[message.channel.id]
    if (message.channel.isThread() && signupInfo && message.author.id === signupInfo.userId) {
      // ... logic for handling messages within an active signup thread ...
      if (signupInfo.state === 'awaiting_topic') {
         // ... processes message as topic ...
      }
      else if (signupInfo.state === 'awaiting_date_selection') {
         // ... processes message as date selection ...
      }
      // ... etc ...
    }
```

The problem is that the bot immediately assumes any message received when `signupInfo.state === 'awaiting_topic'` *is* the topic. It doesn't check the content of the message for intent. SebastianS's message ("correct senor bot...") was processed as if it *was* the presentation topic.

**Proposed Fix:**

Instead of blindly accepting the message content as the topic, we should use the LLM to check if the user's message *is* likely a topic submission or just conversational filler.

1.  Add an LLM call within the `if (signupInfo.state === 'awaiting_topic')` block.
2.  The LLM prompt should ask if the user's message seems like a presentation topic. It should respond with 'topic' or 'clarify'.
3.  If the LLM responds with 'topic', proceed as before.
4.  If the LLM responds with 'clarify', the bot should reply asking specifically for the topic again, reminding the user what it's waiting for.

Let's modify `lib/discord/index.js`.

          }
          return
```

The code modification has been applied, Big D. Now, when the bot is in the `awaiting_topic` state within a sign-up thread, it will first use the LLM to check if the user's message looks like a topic.

-   If the LLM confirms it's likely a topic, the bot proceeds with scheduling as before.
-   If the LLM indicates the message isn't a topic (responds 'clarify' or something else), the bot will now politely re-prompt the user for the topic instead of incorrectly assuming the message *was* the topic.

This should prevent the bug where conversational messages were misinterpreted as topic submissions.

Finally, I'll run the tests to ensure this change didn't break anything else.

Great, Big D. All 52 tests passed successfully after the change.

The bug where the bot misinterpreted conversational replies as presentation topics in the sign-up thread should now be fixed. The bot will use an LLM to check the intent before proceeding, and will ask for clarification if the message doesn't seem like a topic.

---

_**User**_

I don't think it was waiting for at topic. I think it just thought the mention meant the user wanted to sign up

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You are absolutely right, Big D. My apologies. I focused on the interaction *within* the thread shown in the image, but the problem likely originated earlier.

Looking at the code again, specifically the section handling mentions outside of threads (starting around line 291 in the file you attached):

```javascript
    if (!message.mentions.has(client.user.id)) return // Ignore if not mentioned

    console.log(`Bot mentioned by ${message.author.tag} in channel ${message.channel.id}`)
    const userMessageContent = message.content.replace(/<@!?\\d+>/g, '').trim()

    try { // Outer try for intent detection + handling
      const systemMessage = "You are a helpful assistant determining user intent. The user might want to 'sign_up' to speak, 'view_schedule', or 'cancel_talk'. Respond with only the intent name (e.g., 'sign_up', 'view_schedule', 'cancel_talk')."
      
      console.log(`Sending to LLM: \"${userMessageContent}\"`)
      const intentResponse = await completion({ ... }) // LLM Call
      const detectedIntent = intentResponse?.trim().toLowerCase()
      console.log(`LLM detected intent: ${detectedIntent}`)

      if (detectedIntent === 'sign_up') {
        // !!! This is where the thread gets created !!!
        const thread = await message.startThread({ ... }) 
        activeSignups[thread.id] = { userId: message.author.id, state: 'awaiting_topic' }
        await thread.send(...) // Asks for topic
      } 
      // ... handle view_schedule, cancel_talk ...
      else { // Unrecognized intent
         await message.reply("Sorry, I'm not sure how to help...")
      }
    // ... error handling ...
    }
```

You're correct. SebastianS's message "correct senor bot..." was likely a *reply* in the main channel. The bot detected the mention (`@AI In Action Bot`) and sent the message content to the LLM for intent detection. The current system prompt is quite basic and might have incorrectly classified this conversational reply as a `sign_up` intent, leading to the creation of the thread and the inappropriate request for a topic.

**The Fix:**

We need to make the initial intent detection more robust to avoid misinterpreting simple mentions or replies. Let's refine the system prompt used when the bot is mentioned.

**Revised System Prompt:**

```
You are an assistant classifying user intent in a Discord message where the bot was mentioned. Possible intents are 'sign_up', 'view_schedule', 'cancel_talk', or 'other'.
- Classify as 'sign_up' ONLY if the user explicitly asks to sign up, volunteer, present, or talk.
- Classify as 'view_schedule' ONLY if the user explicitly asks to see the schedule, upcoming talks, or who is speaking.
- Classify as 'cancel_talk' ONLY if the user explicitly asks to cancel, withdraw, or back out of their scheduled talk.
- Otherwise, classify as 'other'. This includes simple replies, acknowledgements, questions not related to the above, or unclear requests.
Respond with ONLY the intent name ('sign_up', 'view_schedule', 'cancel_talk', 'other').
```

This revised prompt is more specific about the required phrasing and adds an `other` category to catch conversational messages. We'll also update the `else` block to handle the `other` intent gracefully (perhaps by not replying at all, or with a more general help message if needed, but for now, just ignoring it seems best to avoid noise).

Let's apply this change to `lib/discord/index.js`.

      try { // Outer try for intent detection + handling

Excellent, Big D. The tests passed again.

This revised approach, focusing on more robust intent detection when the bot is mentioned initially, should prevent the bot from incorrectly starting the sign-up flow for conversational replies like the one from SebastianS. It will now only initiate sign-up if the user explicitly asks.
