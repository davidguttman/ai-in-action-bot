Okay Big D, I can help with that. I'll modify the `lib/discord/commands/llm.js` file to include the original prompt in the reply.

I will edit the `execute` function in `lib/discord/commands/llm.js` to prepend the prompt to the response.

```diff
      try {
        const response = await llm.completion({ prompt, model, systemMessage, maxTokens })
-       return interaction.editReply(response)
+       return interaction.editReply(`> ${prompt}
+ 
+ ${response}`)
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('LLM error:', err)
```

Alright Big D, I've updated the `llm.js` command to include the prompt in the reply.
